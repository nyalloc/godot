I want to get up to speed with TAA.

Godot's TAA seems a little underdeveloped. This seems like a good oppertunity to sharpen my skills and do a bit of a rewrite.

QUESTIONS:

Jitter
What sequence? Where is it applied?
Halton(2, 3)
E:\Development\godot\servers\rendering\renderer_scene_cull.cpp

Motion Vectors
Motion Vector support. Need full scene motion vectors. What is missing? How much of a pain will it be, especially for skinned animations?
Godot is Forward+. Do they partial or full pre-pass? Can Velocity be output early?
Jittered or not?
Dilation?
Exported during main fwd+ Color Pass.
UV space motion vectors. Jitter eliminated.

Masking
Didn't see any kind of masing for driving reactivity or anything like that.

Test Scenes
What's a good sample with a spread of content?
 - skinned characters
 - vehicles
 - alpha tested thin-detail geometry
 - various light conditions

Tooling
Prefer to work in PIX so I'll need to see about a D3D12 enabled build.
Any way to take advantage of a shader hot reload?
