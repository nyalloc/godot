I want to get up to speed with TAA.

Godot's TAA seems a little underdeveloped. This seems like a good oppertunity to sharpen my skills and do a bit of a rewrite.

DEBUGGING / DEV MENU

I'd like an on-screen imgui thing that I can use to switch between different TAA configs / permutations.
There is an imgui plugin.
I could add all the TAA debugging features to that, letting you pause time and render overlays etc.
A DLSS-style accumulation debugger would be good which exaggerates motion vectors in order to find fucked up materials.

QUESTIONS:

Jitter
What sequence? Where is it applied?
Halton(2, 3)
E:\Development\godot\servers\rendering\renderer_scene_cull.cpp
Try R2.

Motion Vectors
Motion Vector support. Need full scene motion vectors. What is missing? How much of a pain will it be, especially for skinned animations?
Godot is Forward+. Do they partial or full pre-pass? Can Velocity be output early?
Jittered or not?
Dilation?
Exported during main fwd+ Color Pass.
UV space motion vectors. Jitter eliminated.

Masking
Didn't see any kind of masing for driving reactivity or anything like that.

Test Scenes
What's a good sample with a spread of content?
 - skinned characters
 - vehicles
 - alpha tested thin-detail geometry
 - various light conditions

Tooling
Prefer to work in PIX so I'll need to see about a D3D12 enabled build.
Any way to take advantage of a shader hot reload?

COMPARISON:

Once this is far enough along, it'd be great to A/B test it against the vanilla TAA solution in terms of quality and performance.
